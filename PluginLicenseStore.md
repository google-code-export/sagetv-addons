# Project Wide Lifetime License #
#### Price: FREE! ####

The project wide lifetime license unlocks every version of every plugin in this project.  It will also unlock all versions of all future plugins produced by this project.

**(05 Aug 2013) NOTE:** Effective Aug 5, 2013, licenses can no longer be purchased for this project.  Instead, users can upgrade to the latest version of the sagetv-addons license server plugin.  This update will remove the validation of license files and provide a lifetime license equivalent for every user.  Effectively, this removes the license requirement for all plugins from this project.  This is much easier for me to do than to go back and strip all the license validation code from existing plugins.  I still encourage users who find the various plugins of this project useful to make a donation directly to the [Canadian Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.ca).

**(05 Mar 2012) NOTE:** It was announced on June 18, 2011 that [SageTV has been acquired by Google](http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=56074).  Since then, there has been no official update as to the future of SageTV and there appears to be no official announcement in sight.  Google's silence over the last nine months has spoken volumes to me, personally, and their silence has made me pause various development ideas for this platform.  Over the last few weeks I've decided to cease development on this platform and move onto other projects of interest.  Therefore, effective, immediately, there will be no further development of any plugins within this project.  I have immediately stopped taking payment for single app licenses and have lowered the lifetime license price to $10.72 (CAD).  Why this number?  After Paypal takes their cut, I'm left with $10 net on international transactions ($10.11 on domestic transactions) and that $10 will be donated to the [Canadian Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.ca/).  Your support of this charity is greatly appreciated.

**Please be aware that NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS PLANNED for any of the plugins on this site.  Your purchase of a license unlocks the current versions of everything, but no new updates or versions are planned for anything.**

Updates **_may_** find their way to the SageTV repository if I encounter a bug in my environment and feel the need to fix it, otherwise do not expect any new code releases other than what's in the repository now.
