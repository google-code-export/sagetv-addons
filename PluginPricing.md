# Introduction #

Until now, all sagetv-addons plugins were grouped under one license and that single license gave access to all of the applications in this project.

The biggest complaint I've received with this model is that some users only use one of the plugins and feel as though they're over paying for it.

Well, today I'm happy to address those concerns with the changes outlined below.

# Two Price Levels #

This project will now issue licenses per application allowing users to only pay for the plugin(s) they use.  There is also a single "project wide" license that serves the same function as the old donation based license you may have received in the past.

## Single Plugin License ##

**05 Mar 2012: Effective immediately, single app licenses are no longer available.  Only the lifetime license is available.  The free trials are still available.**

The single plugin license will unlock the locked features of the plugin for which it is issued and nothing more.  If you purchase a single license for SJQv4 then the license issued will only work for SJQv4 and will not unlock features for other plugins from this project.

Plugin prices are as follows:

| **Plugin** | **Price`*`** |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| EPG Plugin v1.x^ | $6.99 |
| SageAlert v2.x | $4.99 |
| Sage Job Queue (SJQ) v4.x | $4.99 |
| Sage Recording Extender (SRE) v4.x | $5.99 |
| SageGroovy IDE v4.x | $1.49 |

**`*` All prices in Canadian dollars**

**`^` The single version license for EPG v1.x is also valid for the beta versions (v0.x)**

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is important to realize that the license is only good for the major point release for which it is issued.  For example, an SJQ v4.x license will only be good for SJQ v4.x.  If/when SJQ v5.x is released, a new single plugin license would be required.

**IMPORTANT NOTE 2:** Plugins are delivered via the SageTV v7.x plugin manager.  Currently, the plugin manager supports one version of a plugin at a time. So if a new major release of a plugin becomes available then official support for the old major releases ends.  If the SageTV plugin manager is enhanced to support multiple versions of plugins then this rule may be changed.

### 7 Day Free Trial ###

You may also receive a 7 day free trial license for any single application.  All plugins have some functionality without a license, but you may obtain a 7-day trial license that will unlock all features of a plugin for 7 days.

## Project Wide License ##

The project wide license is a single license that unlocks all features of all plugins in this project.  Furthermore, a project wide license is a **one time only purchase and is good for all major point releases of all plugins.**  Unlike the single plugin licenses that require an upgrade with each major point release, the project wide license is **good for the duration of this project** and is also good **for all new plugins published by this project.**

| **License Type** | **Price`*`** |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Project Wide License | $10.72 |

**`*` All prices in Canadian dollars**

**05 Mar 2012: Effectively immediately, development of all plugins has stopped.  More details available here http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=58147.**

# FAQ #

## Does a license entitle me to priority support? ##

No, sorry.  A license simply unlocks the features that are locked without it.  If you want support, I'd have to charge a lot more than five bucks per license.  With that said, definitely post in the support threads in the SageTV user forums.  I think you'll find my response times to be rather quick.  Also, for more formal issue tracking, do not hesitate to open [issue tickets](http://code.google.com/p/sagetv-addons/issues/list) within the project.

## Does a license entitle me to priority feature requests? ##

No, sorry.  You're free to post feature requests either in the user forums or via an [issue ticket](http://code.google.com/p/sagetv-addons/issues/list), but the fate of such requests is not influenced by whether or not you've purchased a license.

## Now I'm confused.  What's a license for then? ##

It unlocks the features that are locked without it in each plugin.  See the next question to learn why there's licensing in the first place.

## Why are you requiring a license? ##

First, I don't require a license.  See [here](http://code.google.com/p/sagetv-addons/wiki/PluginPricing#I_can't_afford_this/you're_plugins_aren't_worth_t).

The licenses help offset the expenses involved in plugin development.  These expenses include additional SageTV licenses and hardware used within my development environment.  I don't make money and if revenue exceeds expenses then I donate net proceeds to local charities.

Licenses also help gauge active interest in the various plugins within the project.  If certain plugins aren't generating licensing requests  then I may slow down development on said plugins.

## How is plugin pricing set? ##

Single plugin prices are set based on the time taken to write the plugin plus the time I expect to have to spend supporting the plugin through code updates, user support requests, and feature enhancements.

Pricing can change at any time.

## How is the project wide license price set? ##

Honestly, $19.99 seemed like a good number.  That's all there was to that.

Pricing can change at any time.

## I can't afford this/you're plugins aren't worth the asking price!  Are there alternatives? ##

Yes, how does _free_ sound?  Sounds good, eh?  Please note that all of my plugins in this project are open source software.  The source code for all plugins sits a click away - just click "Source" at the top of this page.  If you can't/don't want to pay for licenses then simply download the source code, strip the licensing validation code from the plugin, build it and deploy it locally.  Doing so gives you a fully unlocked plugin for free.  The license server used by this project also has its source code in this svn repository.  I'm not hiding anything.

There are advantages to licensing:

  * All plugin installs and updates are available via the SageTV plugin manager.
  * You don't have to build and deploy plugins yourself.
  * You don't have to rebuild and redeploy on each code change/bug fix.
  * I do all the testing before code is released to the repository.

Again, if you can't afford a license or you don't feel my work is worth the cost then rest assured there are alternatives.

## I donated for a sagetv-addons license, what happens to that? ##

As promised before, all sagetv-addons licenses will be good for everything for ever so those licenses will be upgraded to a "project wide" license.  You will receive it in your inbox before it is required.

I am truly thankful to all of those who have donated to date.  Your donations helped build my current development environment and your use and feedback of my plugins has helped shape my future plans within SageTV.

## Why am I paying $19.99 for something that everyone else paid $7.50 for!? ##

**(Updated 15 Jun 2011)** Timing is everything, sorry.

**(Updated 05 Mar 2012)** Good news, the cost is now $10.72!  Note that development has stopped on this project.  See [here](http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=58147) for more details.

## How do I get a refund? ##

Sorry, no refunds.  Once a key is issued it cannot be revoked.  All plugins have some functionality for free and you are able to get a 7 day free trial license to unlock all features for a plugin before purchasing a license.  Be sure you want/need a license and **be sure you're purchasing a license for the proper plugin!**
