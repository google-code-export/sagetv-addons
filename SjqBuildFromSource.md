# Building SJQ from Source Code #

If you wish to build SJQ from source you can do so by following the build document for [SageAlert](SageAlertBuildFromSource.md).  You should basically be able to follow that document verbatim for building SJQ.  There are probably a few "common sense" differences when using the doc for SJQ, but if you're taking on a build from source exercise then I'll assume you'll be able to spot those difference and account for them accordingly.

If there are major differences or glaring omissions required to build SJQ then please let me know.
